Q1. What is cherry-pick? Explain the use case of it and also write steps to do it.

Ans. ### **Git Cherry-Pick**  
`git cherry-pick` is a command used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another without merging all changes. It is useful when you need to transfer a bug fix or a particular feature without pulling unwanted commits.  

### **Use Case**  
Suppose a critical bug fix is committed in a feature branch, but the main branch needs it immediately. Instead of merging the entire branch, `git cherry-pick` allows applying only that specific commit.  

### **Steps to Use Cherry-Pick**  
1. **Switch to the target branch:**  
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   ```  
2. **Find the commit hash:**  
   ```sh
   git log --oneline
   ```  
3. **Cherry-pick the commit:**  
   ```sh
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
   ```  
4. **Resolve conflicts (if any):**  
   ```sh
   git add .
   git cherry-pick --continue
   ```  
5. **Push the changes:**  
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```  

This ensures that only the necessary changes are applied without affecting other commits. ðŸš€
