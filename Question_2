Q2. How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the use case. you should have a working demo of it.

Ans . To set multiple remote repositories for the same project in Git, follow these steps:

### **Steps to Set Up Multiple Remotes:**

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**  
   Open a terminal and go to your project's directory:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. **Initialize Git (if not already done)**  
   ```sh
   git init
   ```

3. **Add the First Remote Repository (origin)**  
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo1.git
   ```

4. **Add the Second Remote Repository (backup or another remote)**  
   ```sh
   git remote add backup https://gitlab.com/user/repo2.git
   ```

5. **Verify the Added Remotes**  
   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```

6. **Push to Multiple Remotes Separately**  
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   git push backup main
   ```

7. **Setting Up a Remote for Fetching & Pulling (Optional)**  
   If you want to fetch from both remotes:
   ```sh
   git fetch --all
   ```

### **Use Case:**
Having multiple remotes is useful in scenarios such as:
- **Backup:** Store code on GitHub and GitLab simultaneously.
- **Collaboration:** One repo for the companyâ€™s internal use, another for open-source contributions.
- **Different Deployment Environments:** Push to separate repositories for production and development.

---

### **Working Demo**
I will now provide a working script to demonstrate setting up multiple remotes.

This script initializes a Git repository, commits a README file, adds two remotes (`origin` and `backup`), and pushes the code to both repositories. Run this script to see how multiple remotes work in Git. ðŸš€
